# Data Structure: AVL Tree

## Description
Experiment with concepts of AVL tree, or the self-balancing binary search tree in specific. In this project, we can see how:
* Create attributes of the AVL tree
* Implement multiple functions to achieve self-balancing
  * Create the function to calculate the height of a specific node as a foundation to calculate the balance factor (balance factor is the number used to check if the subtree is left heavy (factor > 1), right heavy (factor < -1), or balanced (factor >= -1 && factor <= 1))
  * Create the function to calculate balance factor based on the height of the node
  * Create the function for left-rotating
  * Create the function for right-rotating
* Insert an element into the AVL tree (the AVL tree will be self-balanced when the balance factor is out of the balanced range)
